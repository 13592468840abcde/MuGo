'''
Features used by AlphaGo, in approximate order of importance.
Feature                 # Notes
Stone colour            3 Player stones; oppo. stones; empty  
Turns since last move   8 How many turns since a move played
Liberties               8 Number of liberties
Capture size            8 How many opponent stones would be captured
Self-atari size         8 How many own stones would be captured
Liberties after move    8 Number of liberties after this move played
ladder capture          1 Whether a move is a successful ladder cap
Ladder escape           1 Whether a move is a successful ladder escape
Sensibleness            1 Whether a move is legal + doesn't fill own eye
Zeros                   1 Constant plane of 0s
Ones                    1 Constant plane of 1s

All features with 8 planes are 1-hot encoded, with plane i marked with 1 
only if the feature was equal to i. Any features >= 8 would be marked as 8.

    '''
    From the AlphaGo paper: 
    Each integer feature value is split into multiple 19 Ã— 19 planes of binary values (one-hot encoding). For example, separate binary feature planes are used to represent whether an intersection has 1 liberty, 2 liberties,..., >=8 liberties.
